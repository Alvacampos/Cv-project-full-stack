# Project Cv Full Stack

Welcome to the vanilla stage of this project, here we will only use HTML, CSS and JS.

## Installation Guide

First do an npm install, yeah I know we talked that this was vanilla but we will use live-server to make the development a lot more friendly.

## Live-server

- run npm `install -g live-server`
- npm run dev -> to run live-server and allow your vanilla app to have hot reload.

## Tailwind

- To run tailwind use another console (not the live server) and run `npx tailwindcss -i ./src/input.css -o ./dist/output.css --watch`
