# Month to Month work

We will try to sort the project in "months", what does this means? We will divide each month with topics to learn or implement. Feel free to take more or less time this is just a guide and follow the guide to develop your own project or follow mine.

Here you will have some basic definitions with links to free crash courses or tutorials in youtube. In the future this section might get expand.

## Issues

Since this is part a personal project/study guide we will create tickets/issues to distribute the work among the current participants, feel free to fork this repo and create your own [project](https://github.com/features/issues) this is a new github feature that will help you simulate a real work process.

## Months 1 & 2:

First we need to learn a few things. And install a few others.

### What we need to learn?

- What is [HTML](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qz0aGYrrlhU&ab_channel=ProgrammingwithMosh)? HTML means HyperText Markup Language. If we think of think this project like a human body HTML would be the bones, the basic structure and what serves as the structure that will support all the rest. This is **NOT** a programming language, is a markup language.

- What is [CSS](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yfoY53QXEnI&ab_channel=TraversyMedia)? CSS means Cascading Style Sheets. This would be the skin of the body, the "pretty" part, what we look at every time we visit the page. With this we can give our project color, shapes and much more.

- What is [JS](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W6NZfCO5SIk&ab_channel=ProgrammingwithMosh)? Js, JavaScript ECMAScript (basically they are all the same JavaScript) its a programming language, you can think about it like the muscles of the body what enables movement and allows us to interact with others. I few things to have into account, JS is not similar or a lost brother of Java, the Java in JS was just to lure developers into check in it out when it was in its early steps. Now a days its more common to call it just JS. [Here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkZNo7MFNFg&ab_channel=freeCodeCamp.org) is a more in depth course but also a lot longer.

- What is [GIT](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWYqp7iY_Tc&t=843s&ab_channel=TraversyMedia)? It's a version control for tracking changes in a computer files, this allows multiple programmers to work on the same project. You can think of it as a stop light, it coordinates who can pass through in an orderly fashion. It comes with it own CMD and many other features. Remember that you should respect the [Main Branches](#main-branches) and try to follow the [Branching Rules](#branching-rules)

### What you need to install?

For most project you will use a few things.

- [GIT](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWYqp7iY_Tc&t=843s&ab_channel=TraversyMedia)
- [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)
- [VsCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/download)
