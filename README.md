# Project Cv Full Stack

This will be a full stack project for learning purposes and will contain the following tools and technologies. The project will consist in a basic three tier arquitecture and will be mainly focued on JavaScript.
We will use a very basic kaban aproach with tickets using the issue board provided by github plus we will implement dailies and every other necesary ceremony in order to have an idea of a developers day to day activities.

From now on some words and phrases will be shorten to the following:
Front End - FE
Back End - BE
JavaScript - JS
Data Base - DB

# Font End

- HTML
- CSS
- Bootstrap
- JavaScript
- React
- Redux(if posible)

# Back End

- Nodejs/GraphQL

# Back End

- MongoDB

# Stages of the project

Next the different stages of the project will be listed and explain, feel free to return to X date commit to check the project development process.

### Basic Vanilla Front End

Due to learning purposes first the FE will be developed very basically just with vanilla JS (plus html and css) to get a better grasp on the previously mention topics.

### Upgrade to React

At this point we have a better understanding on the basics of HTML, CSS and JS and we will migrate to ReactJs to do the same learning process. **IF** posible we will try to implement most of Reacts features even if the sound overkill for a project of this scale. (Remember we aim to learn).

### Basic Back End

Here we will beggin working on the BE, like the FE at the start we will do the basics, take a request and return a response.

### Data Base

Now that we have a basic BE we can hook it up to a DB, a free tier mongo DB for this project will be more than enough.

### End 2 End

Now at we have all the basics we can work on all the tiers at the same time to have a better work flow. At this point most tickets will involved a full stack work.

### Testing

Since testing is not the main focus but a nice to have we will start implementing testing at the end and the coverage won't be a main concern, we will try to reach 100% of the code with unit tests but we make no promises.

## Files and folders

The project will be separated in two folders, Front-End and Back-End, each folder contains _.md_ files for instalation guides and more info regarding features.

## Work flow

We will keep the work flow simple:
To-Do -> In progress -> In review -> Done/Blocked

We will have tags to clarified that a ticket is ready to be taken:
_groomed_

Other relevant tags will be listed here.
